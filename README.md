# ESDA (Epileptic Seizure Detection using Arduino)
Epileptic seizure is a neurological disorder caused by unusual nerve cell activity in the brain. In this disease the person loses consciousness and falls at his place, which might lead to severe injuries. After getting up he won’t even realize what happened to him, as he won’t have any memory just before he lost consciousness.
